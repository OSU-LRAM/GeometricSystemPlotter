%%%%%%%
% This is a helper-function for N_link_chain. 
%
% N_link_chain takes in an argument that specifies which link on the chain
% (or another frame, such as a center-of-mass frame or one loaded from a
% system file) should be used as the base frame.
%
% All of the N_link_chain calculations are made with the lowest-numbered
% (leftmost, or 'tail') link as the base frame.
%
% Transforming the positions of the links relative to the base frame is
% straightforward: We simply multiply each transformation by the inverse of
% the transformation from the old base frame to the new base frame
%
% To transform the link Jacobians into the new coordinates, we need the
% Jacobian from joint velocities to body velocity of new frame, with
% first link fixed. This calculation depends on how the kinematic map
% from the original base frame to the new base frame is calculated.
%
% The code in this file handles the special cases required for finding the
% transformation and Jacobian from the old base frame to the new base frame
% for different specifications of the new base frame.
%
% The actual transformation of the link matrices and Jacobians is handled
% by N_link_conversion.
