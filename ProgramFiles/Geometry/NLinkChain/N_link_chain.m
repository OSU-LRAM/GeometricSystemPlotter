% Build a backbone for a chain of links, specified as a vector of link
% lengths and the joint angles between them.
%
% Inputs:
%
%   geometry: Structure containing information about geometry of chain.
%       Fields are:
%
%       linklengths: A vector of link lengths defining a kinematic chain
%
%       baseframe (optional): Specification of which link on the body should be
%           treated as the base frame. Default behavior is to put the base
%           frame at the center of the chain, either at the midpoint of the
%           middle link, or at the joint between the two middle links and at
%           the mean of their orientation. Options for this field are:
% 
%               'centered' :    Default behavior
%               'tail' :        Lowest-numbered link is the base frame
%               'head' :        Highest-numbered link is the base frame
%               'head-tip':     End of the highest-numbered link is the base frame
%               'tail-tip':     Start of the lowest numbered link is the
%                                   base frame
%               numeric :       Specify a link number to use as a base frame
%               sysf_           Pull minimum-perturbation coordinates from a
%                                       sysf_ file. Argument should be the name of
%                                       a system in the current UserFiles folder
%
%       length (optional): Total length of the chain. If specified, the elements of
%           will be scaled such that their sum is equal to L. If this field
%           is not provided or is entered as an empty matrix, then the links
%           will not be scaled.
%
%   jointangles: A vector of the angles between the links. Must be one
%       element shorter than the linklengths vector
%
%   
%
%
% Outputs:
%
%   h : Locations of the chain links relative to the selected base frame,
%           and lengths of the links
%
%       h.pos: The link locations are stored in an Nx3 array, with
%           each row a link and the columns corresponding to x,y,theta
%           values for that link. These can be converted to stacks of SE(2)
%           matrices via vec_to_mat_SE2, and back to vectors by
%           mat_to_vec_SE(2)
%   
%   	h.lengths : Vector of linklengths. This is the original link length
%           specification passed into the function, scaled by L, and stored
%           as a column of values.
%
%   J : Jacobians from joint angle velocities to velocity of each link
%           relative to  the base frame (the standard derivative of h).
%           These Jacobians are stored in a cell array, with one matrix per
%           cell.
%
%   J_full : Full Jacobians from body velocity of the base frame and joint
%           angle velocities to body velocity of each link relative to a
%           non-moving frame.
%
%   frame_zero : The transformation from the first link to the selected
%           baseframe
%
%   J_zero : The Jacobian from shape velocity to body velocity of the
%       selected baseframe, with the first link held fixed.
%
