function [A, h, J, J_full, omega, M_full, local_inertias] = Inertial_connection_discrete(geometry,physics,jointangles)
% Calculate the local connection for for an inertial system (floating in space or
% ideal high-Re fluid)
%
% Inputs:
%
%   geometry: Structure containing information about geometry of chain.
%       Fields required for this function are:
%
%       linklengths: A vector of link lengths defining a kinematic chain
%
%       baseframe (optional): Specification of which link on the body should be
%           treated as the base frame. Default behavior is to put the base
%           frame at the center of the chain, either at the midpoint of the
%           middle link, or at the joint between the two middle links and at
%           the mean of their orientation. Options for this field are
%           specified in the documentation of N_link_chain.
%
%       length (optional): Total length of the chain. If specified, the elements of
%           will be scaled such that their sum is equal to L. If this field
%          is not provided or is entered as an empty matrix, then the links
%          will not be scaled.
%
%       link_shape: string naming what kind of object the link is
%
%       link_shape_parameters: structure containing parameters of link
%         shape
%
%   physics: Structure containing information about the system's physics.
%       Fields are:
%
%       fluid_density: density of fluid surrounding object, relative to
%         object
%
%   jointangles: Angles of the joints between the links, defining the
%       chain's current shape.
%
% Outputs:
%
%   A: The "local connection" matrix, or "Locomotion Jacobian". This matrix
%       maps joint angular velocities ("shape velocities") to body
%       velocities of the system's base frame as 
%
%            g_b = -A * alphadot
%
%       with g_b the body velocity and alphadot the joint angular velocity.
%
%       (Note the negative sign in this equation; sysplotter code uses the
%       classical formulation of the geometric mechanics equations, which
%       includes this negative sign.
%
%   [h,J,J_full]: location and Jacobians for the links on the chain. These
%       are passed through from N_link_chain; see the documentation on that
%       function for more details
%
%   omega: The "Pfaffian constraint matrix" from which the local connection
%       A is calculated. This matrix is a linear map from system body and
%       shape velocities to net external forces acting on the base frame,
%       which must be zero for all achievable motions of the system
%
%   local_inertias: The inertia tensor of the link as measured in its fixed
%       coordinate frame, which includes the added mass from the surrounding
%       fluid.


    %%%%
    % First, get the positions of the links in the chain and their
    % Jacobians with respect to the system parameters

    %%%%%%%%
    % We are modeling low Reynolds number physics as being resistive
    % viscous force, with a quasistatic equilibrium condition that inertial
    % forces are negligable, so that the viscous drag on the whole system
    % is zero at any given time. (The drag is anisotropic, so the system
    % can actually be moving even though there is no net force acting on
    % it).
    %
    % Because viscous drag is linear, we can build a linear map from the
    % body velocity of a given link to the force and moment acting on the
    % link.
    % 
    % Further, because the velocity kinematics from the system's body and
    % shape velocities to the body velocity of each link are linearly
    % encoded by the Jacobians of the links, we can use these Jacobians to
    % pull the drag operators on the links back onto the space of system
    % body and shape velocities, giving us a linear map from the system's
    % body and shape velocity to the net forces acting on the system
    %    
    % To calculate this linear mapping, we first pre-allocate storage for
    % the metric contributions. Each contribution is 3 x m (rows for
    % x,y,theta motion, and one column per joint), and there is one
    % contribution per link. This structure is of the same dimensions as
    % J_full, so we use it as a template.
